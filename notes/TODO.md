- [ ] Mock all parts of the project
- [ ] Create examples from the dacapo benchmark
- [x] rename packages to cz.cuni.mff
- [ ] Represent Trace as an interface that allows to query values and method that were called at a certain point in time - if there's nothing to return, handle it as the Optional monad
- [ ] Pick an UI framework: https://github.com/JetBrains/jewel?tab=readme-ov-file

	- [ ] UI framework selection
- [ ] Make DISL_PATH from Gradle accessible from the code
- DiSL functionality
	- [x] Method parameters
		- At the time of the method call
	- [x] Return values
	- [x] Field writes
		- Don't care about the line numbers of the writes, only the possible values 
	- [ ] Static field writes
		- Don't care about the line numbers of the writes, only the possible values 
- [ ] Remove all generated sources before building (via Gradle task)
- [ ] Map variable names to slot indices
- Tests

- [x] Create a PNG folder in notes for individual diagrams
- [ ] Configure Gradle to compile test resources into separate JARs
- Write down a section of encountered problems
	- [ ] Modeling (metaclasses etc.)

		- [ ] External types specific to just the target app
	- [ ] Tech debt
	- [ ] Development testing  
	- [ ] Access to sources
		- [ ] Makes things easier, for example getting fields from a class makes use of imports
## Until 6th August
- [ ] Sending values from `Instrumentation` to `auto-debugger` 
- [ ] Generating tests based on values - all parameter values used for running tests
