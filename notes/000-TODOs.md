# TOPIC: Data Capture Library

* thoroughly check for alignment issues and other UB
    * check for alignment on llcap-server side [in progress]

## Capturing funciton arguments

* **[DONE]** how to treat **templated** code
    * let `X` be the set of types allowed for recording:
    * `template <class T>`, parameter of type `T`, where all instantiations of `T` in `X` - should be OK with naive source modification
    * not all instantiations have `T` in `X` -> compilation errors
        * how to resolve?
        * can clang provide per-instantiation decisionmaking? how will that affect compile times/feasability?

* **[DONE]** how to treat type aliases?
    * should be doable via clang's APIs (the underlying type should be resolved, right?)

## Capturing execution trace 

* use other tools?

* **[DONE]** C vs C++ function scope tracking
    * for now I only focus on C++ code, this method should allow tracing of even code which throws exceptions
    * C has no "reasonably non-colliding" namespaces
    * on the other hand: no annoying exceptions

* **[DONE]** use of C++'s `auto` keyword
    * limits C heavily (`auto` not used widely)
    * intricacies of C++'s type system & reference semantics
        * ensuring that modified source code makes exactly the same side effects as the unmodified one

# TOPIC: C++ support

*  **[DUPLICATE]** ~~methods of objects with AST modification (abandoned?)~~

# TOPIC: LLVM IR approach

* shows more promise than AST modification
* trouble with filtering (non) library funcitons - information not available in the IR
    * **[DONE]** **Idea**: add metadata to the functions in the IR that could tell the LLVM pass if the function is `#include`d, library, ...
        * [LLVM Discussion](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/how-to-distinguish-between-user-defined-function-in-a-program-and-library-functions/54401/7)
    * more metadata could help with a GUI integration later (emitting line information metadata - *using debug information metadata*, ...)
    * **[DONE]** inject custom metadata regarding (non)library/builtin functions
* **[DONE]** capturing inside a lambda, overall lambda instrumentation
* **[DONE]** LLVM [intrinsics](http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#intrinsics) - can they be used?
    * **warning, can affect code generation**
    * lack of documentation (e.g. `llvm.memcpy`)
    * even then, seem inconsequential

* **[DONE]** **important for custom IR metadata**: `isExpansionInMainFile` vs `isExpansionInSystemHeader`
    * Does `isExpansionInMainFile` exclude functions in **any** header files?
        * If yes, does `isExpansionInSystemHeader` solve this?

* **[DONE]** is the custom metadata approach outlined in [](./01-llvm-ir-metadata-emission.md#custom-llvm-ir-metadata) correct?
* **[DONE]** is it possible to inject metadata in the AST Matching phase?
    * e.g. visit every `FunctionDecl` and add data (key-value string pairs) that would later be injected as LLVM IR metadata? (this is a question because the AST itself (and `FunctionDecl`) seemed to be "`const`ant" throughout my experimentation)

* **[DONE]** investigate [Clang IR (CIR)](https://llvm.github.io/clangir/)
    * relatively new feature (doesn't seem to be used with my build of LLVM) - *ClangIR upstreaming RFC was accepted in Feb 2024,*
    * conclusion: probably useful in far future (dialect augmentation)

* **[DONE]** add an option to metadata export plugin to use mangled name approach via a plugin option
    * supply LLVM pass & use `-mllvm -llcap-filter-by-mangled` when compiling

* `custom-metadata-pass` - document build steps

# TOPIC: Typed value capture
* **[DONE]** document hurdles / bypasses / alternatives to LLVM metadata approach
    * `this` pointer
    * ABIs that return structures by value in registers (`sret`, `structureReturn`, `StructRet`)
    * **?maybe?** - dive deeper into the ABI specs and cause runtime error within the LLVM plugin if the target ABI is unknown/unhandled
* **[DONE]** document current approach
* **[DONE]** discuss possible breakage points
    * structures fitting 64 bits passed in registers
    * changes in argument order
* try to use LLVM debug information metadata to perform instrumentation **without** the LLVM metadata customization  

# TOPIC: Testing / Isolation
* isolation inspiration - to investigate? - (`clone`/`fork` used): [mem-isolate](https://github.com/brannondorsey/mem-isolate)
* document architecture of testing, new hooklib, diagrams, ...
* send termination signal to a fork that timed out
* `I | [main] Run program for fn m: F7DB0979 f: 03000000` - add name and module path (nonverbose output)

# TOPIC: Papers

* investigate memory instruction instrumentation via Pin from the AURORA tool
    * [repo](https://github.com/RUB-SysSec/aurora)

# TOPIC: Modification of incoming arguments
* **[DONE?]** are there assumptions in the IR, that would break if we replaced arguments mid-function?
    * **[DONE]** the idea is to "introduce new `alloca`d variable (`%x`)" for each `%n` argument and replace each `%n` occurence with the new `%x`
* `const`ness vs `IR`-level modifications
    * does `-O3`, etc. impact the number of arguments in IR? (e.g. via more agressive const propagation?)
    * if prohibitive for argument "hijacking", can we at least "remove" `const`
* **[DONE]** validate approach that modifies the IR
* add smaller demo (replace the current demo) that shows everything on a smaller scale
    * particularly the argument replacement part (simple visual confirmation for the user)
* document the architecture, add diagrams

# TOPIC: Extras
* **[CLOSED]** report mangling bug (after rebuild of latest llvm project)
    * actually a [larger issue](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-clang-diagnostic-for-demangling-failures/82835) ([pull request for a diagnostic](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/111391))

* so far only on x64 linux ABI - try more?
* attachment to external tools
    * Valgrind, GDB - obvious candidates (instrument to conditionally trigger a breakpoint?)
        * custom types / implemented std::string currently leaks memory (oneshot), questionable yields
    * property-checking tools (unsinged over/underflow, no-progress loops, suspicious iteration counts, recording & analysis of comparisons at particular location)
    * GCOV - coverage
* aggregate mode of the tools - run test cases with multiple failing instances to allow cross-checking (by the user)
* custom "log expressions" that would report into the framework? (additional info) 
    * ! compatibility with LLVM IR
```c++
    RET_T foo(PT p1, PT p2) { 

        /* start of static instrumentation */
        
        /* user-provided expression that can be serialized/logged 
           e.g. p1 * p2 / (p1 - p2) / ... */
        /* end of static instrumentation */
        
        // function body...
    }
```


# **[DONE]** Revamp of buffer reading and writing

* implemented via `BorrowedReadBuffer` and `BorrowedOneshotWritePtr`

Currently the language rules around mutability and sharing when reading and writing shared
memory buffers are enforced by `RefCell` and a check that "no raw pointer is ever casted from
`*const` to `*mut`".

# Future Work

## Ensuring all exceptions are always detected

In the `fn-exit` instrumentation mode of the [LLVM pass](../sandbox/01-llvm-ir/llvm-pass/) (used by passing `-mllvm -llcap-instrument-fn-exit` to `clang`), only `ret` and `resume` IR instructions are
instrumented. The instrumentation simply inserts a `call hook_test_epilogue` or `hook_test_epilogue_exc` before `ret` and `resume` respectively.

Other exception-handling instructions are not handled yet. The possible soltions and an
LLVM example is linked [here](./00-progress-updates.md#problems--observations) and [here](./00-progress-updates.md#alternative).

If this feature will be implemented, the `-mllvm -llcap-instrument-fn-exit` shall be the default
and instrumentation without `fn-exit` will only serve for debug purposes perhaps.

## Eliminating the need for the LLVM patch

Currently, the LLVM patch is used to "send" data from the AST plugin to the LLVM pass plugin.
This is because of two reasons:
1. Mark functions that are eligible for call tracing (non-library, non-external) so that LLVM pass
may detect them
2. Mark offsets of arguments "of interest" (e.g. the `std::string` type which appears as a pointer in the IR)

The LLVM IR debug metadata may provide enough information to eliminate `2`. (i.e. it should be possible to map the IR argument index to the C++ type of the arugment).

We are unsure with regards to `1` though. So far, the only option that avoids the LLVM patch is
checking of mangled function names which is an ugly and unstable solution.

## More comfortable extension of the AST and IR plugins

In its current form, the AST and IR plugins are extensible only by direct, albeit simple,
[modification of their sources](./development-manual.md#argument-capture-and-type-detection-mechanisms). We believe the plugins can be adjusted to support extension via some sort of
configuration files supplied to the plugins as arguments (`-mllvm ...`).

Further, the [(de)serialization code](./development-manual.md#deserialization) facilitating 
argument capture and replacement of function arguments could be designed so that extension with a 
custom type would be a matter of creating and linking an additional library (developed alongside 
`hooklib`, using its headers but not recompiling the `hooklib` directly).

The two improvements above would greatly increase developer experience and encourage experimentation
with the tool set.

## Multithreaded target support

Currently we only support instrumentation of single-threaded programs. The main source of this limitation is the [`hooklib` implementation](../sandbox/02-ipc/ipc-hooklib/) which does not synchronize access to or distribute its mutable state among the running threads.
 

 ## Explore fuzzing approaches for injected argument values

 The current form of the workflow simply copies the recorded arguments and "replays" the function calls. We can manually edit the recorded traces to inject other argument values. Creating methods of interactive or automatic addition of argument values would extended the usage of the entire project. Particularly, this setup would allow instrumentation of functions that are "harder to reach" using conventional testing methods in terms of architectural accesibility or the setup of the surrounding program state.
